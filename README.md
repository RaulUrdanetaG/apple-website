## Motivation
In completing this project, my primary objectives were to deepen my understanding of threeJs for 3D model interactivity in the web, and gsap for smooth and clean animations, By immersing myself in these technologies, I aimed to enhance my skill set and gain practical experience that would not only solidify my knowledge but also enable me to build more interesting web sites.
