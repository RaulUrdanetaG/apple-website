## Motivation
In completing this project, my primary objectives were to deepen my understanding of Next.js and to get a good understanding about web socket, and videoconferencing implementations as my primary focus lies in backend development. By immersing myself in these technologies, I aimed to enhance my skill set and gain practical experience that would not only solidify my knowledge but also enable me to build more robust and real-time web applications.
